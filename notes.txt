In the case of a url like #/movies/101, how are the outlets rendered?

First, we always start with the application template.

When {{outlet}} is called in a template, the current route is what
determines which template is going to be used for rendering. The route
can explicitly define a template using the renderTemplate hook.

App.PostsRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  renderTemplate: function() {
    this.render('favoritePost'); # => Use the favorite_post
  }
});

If the route does not specify a renderTemplate() hook, then Ember will
use the name of the route. If the route is called PostsRoute, then Ember
will look for a template called Posts.
